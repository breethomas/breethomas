Hi, I'm Bree 👋

  CPO turned AI builder. Product development got boring for a while there. Now AI has flipped the
  whole thing on its head and I'm having fun again.

  🔨 Building [PM Thought Partner](https://github.com/breethomas/pm-thought-partner), a Claude
  Code plugin that puts elite PM frameworks in your corner when you need to think sharper.

  📐 Maintaining [PM Coding Guardrails](https://github.com/breethomas/pm-coding-guardrails) so PMs
   who vibe code don't make engineers want to kill them.

  🔬 Currently obsessed with LLM evals (because "feels good" isn't a metric), turning SaaS into
  AI-first UX (not just slapping a chatbot on it), and shipping fast with Claude Code in the
  terminal.

  I think PMs should build things, not just spec them. Figuring it out in public. If any of this
  is useful, cool. If not, I had fun making it.

  💅 When I'm not working: making jewelry, talking to robots so I can keep the long acrylic nails.
