## Hey 👋

### What I'm working on

**[PM Thought Partner](https://github.com/breethomas/pm-thought-partner)** - Claude Code plugin that applies PM frameworks through conversation. Four Fits, Four Risks, PMF surveys, modern PRD approach. Basically trying to make AI actually useful for product decisions instead of just generating walls of text.

**[PM Coding Guardrails](https://github.com/breethomas/pm-coding-guardrails)** - Coding standards for PMs who vibe code with AI. Started this after getting feedback from engineers about what actually matters when PMs contribute to shared codebases. Turns out "don't break CI" is step one.

### What I'm into right now

Building evaluation frameworks for LLM features. Turns out "vibes" don't scale and you need actual systematic testing. Who knew?

Figuring out how to transform traditional SaaS UX into AI-first experiences. There's a huge gap between "we added a chatbot" and "we redesigned the experience for how people actually want to interact with AI."

Prototyping fast. I just finished Aman Khan's Prototype to Production course and Parlance Labs' AI Evals course. Currently playing with Claude Code, Cursor, and whatever makes building faster.

### Why I'm here

I think PMs need to get their hands dirty with AI. Not just write specs about it. So I'm building in public, sharing what I learn, and making tools that help other PMs ship better AI products.

Also I like building things that people actually use, so if any of this is helpful, let me know.
