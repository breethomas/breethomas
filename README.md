## Hey 👋

### 🚀 What I'm working on

**[PM Thought Partner](https://github.com/breethomas/pm-thought-partner)** - Claude Code plugin that applies PM frameworks through conversation
- Four Fits, Four Risks, PMF surveys, modern PRD approach
- Trying to make AI actually useful for product decisions instead of just generating walls of text

**[PM Coding Guardrails](https://github.com/breethomas/pm-coding-guardrails)** - Coding standards for PMs who vibe code with AI
- Started after getting feedback from engineers about what actually matters when PMs contribute to shared codebases
- Turns out "don't break CI" is step one

### 🔥 What I'm into right now

- 📊 Building evaluation frameworks for LLM features (turns out "vibes" don't scale)
- 🎨 Transforming traditional SaaS UX into AI-first experiences (there's a huge gap between "we added a chatbot" and "we redesigned the experience")
- ⚡ Prototyping fast with Claude Code, Cursor, and whatever makes building faster
- 🎓 Recently finished: Aman Khan's Prototype to Production + Parlance Labs' AI Evals

### 💡 Why I'm here

I think PMs need to get their hands dirty with AI. Not just write specs about it.

Building in public, sharing what I learn, and making tools that help other PMs ship better AI products.

Also I like building things that people actually use, so if any of this is helpful, let me know.
