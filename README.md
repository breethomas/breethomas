 ## Hey 👋

  CPO turned AI builder. Product development got boring for a while there. Now AI has flipped the
  whole thing on its head and I'm having fun again.

  ### Open source stuff

  **[PM Thought Partner](https://github.com/breethomas/pm-thought-partner)** - Claude Code plugin
  that puts elite PM frameworks in your corner when you need to think sharper.

  **[PM Coding Guardrails](https://github.com/breethomas/pm-coding-guardrails)** - How to vibe
  code without making engineers want to kill you.

  ### Currently obsessed with

  - LLM evals (because "feels good" isn't a metric)
  - Turning SaaS into AI-first UX (not just slapping a chatbot on it)
  - Shipping fast with Claude Code in the terminal

  ### The deal

  PMs should build things, not just spec them. I'm figuring it out in public.

  If any of this is useful, cool. If not, I had fun making it.

  ### When I'm not working

  Making jewelry. Talking to robots so I can keep the long acrylic nails. I use a lot of sports
  metaphors but everything I know about sports is from movies. I do not watch the sports ball.
